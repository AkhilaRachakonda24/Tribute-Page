                <center><h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, into a devout Hindu family. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, served as a chief minister in Porbandar, and his mother, Putlibai, deeply influenced his values. Gandhi's upbringing was rooted in traditional Indian culture and spirituality.

At the age of 13, Gandhi married Kasturba Makhanji, entering into an arranged marriage. After completing his early education in India, Gandhi traveled to England in 1888 to study law at University College London. It was during this time that he encountered various cultures and ideologies that would shape his future activism and philosophy.

He founded the Natal Indian Congress in 1894 and employed nonviolent resistance tactics to protest injustices. These experiences laid the foundation for his later leadership in India's independence movement and the development of his philosophy of Satyagraha.</p></center>
